## Project Structure

This module has the following classes and resources:
- [DataImporter class](src/main/java/com/collibra/importer/app/DataImporter.java) that has utility methods to import CSV, Excel and JSON files. This class
  invokes the generated Importer API client methods. This class also has a submit method that takes an internal model object 'AssetImportCommand' as an argument 
  to demonstrate how we could leverage the model objects generated by the OpenAPI generator and import assets.
- [DataImporterTest class](src/test/java/com/collibra/importer/app/DataImporterTest.java) that reads files from sub-folders in [resources directory](src/test/resources) and tests the data import. 
  This class also tests importing assets using model object 'AssetImportCommand'.
- A series of [import example files](src/test/resources/README.md) that has all example files to help you get started with the Collibra Import API.

## Tests

- Verify the environment variables are configured as per the [Project Configuration](../import-api-java-client/README.md).
- To run an import using files in the example folder execute the
  [DataImporterTest](src/test/java/com/collibra/importer/app/DataImporterTest.java) test.
- To run all the tests, invoke `gradle test`.

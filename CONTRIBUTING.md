Collibra Import API tutorial and examples contribution guidelines
=======

Thank you for your interest in the Collibra Import API tutorial and examples project. We all want to provide the most understandable and useful code for our customers, partners and collaborators to build integrations with Collibra. So we are doing our best to keep this repository up-to-date and provide examples that are both generic enough to be helpful for everyone yet complete enough to get you started. But since perfection is not of this world, we also welcome any collaboration to this project, both from the Collibra team and from third-parties.

If you would like to report an issue with this repository, we will be glad to help you through the usual Collibra support channels, such as Zendesk or your Collibra representative. If you would like to directly submit some improvements to the code, any pull request is welcome and will be reviewed as soon as we can.

We try to follow the following principles when contributing to this repository:
- Use *import-api-java-client* as a generic module for building an import client we can base an application on.
- Use *import-api-tutorial* for simple applications that teach how to use the different features of the import and synchronization components. Each tutorial application can be understood by simply reading 1 source file and is as linear as possible.
- The *data-quality* is expected a simple example of a full application. 

The Collibra Inbound team.
